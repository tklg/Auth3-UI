<p>
The Auth3 Terms of Service (the "Terms" or "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, either an individual or a single legal entity ("You" or "you" or "Your" or "your"), and Auth3 for the Auth3 service ("Auth3" or "Product" or "we" or "our"). These Terms govern your use of Auth3, including any updates and accompanying written documentation.
</p><p>
Your use of Auth3 constitutes your binding legal agreement to these Terms, which are subject to change at any time by Auth3. If you are not legally able to be bound by these Terms, your use of Auth3 is prohibited.
</p><p>
You acknowledge and agree that Auth3 may occasionally contact you via email. Please refer to Auth3's Privacy Policy, (<a href="https://auth.tkluge.net/about/privacy">https://auth.tkluge.net/about/privacy</a>) for information about how we use, transfer and share information we collect and store within Auth3.
</p>
<h2>Accounts, Passwords and Security</h2>
<p>You must be a registered user to access the Product. Individual users must register using their name, and entity users must register under the legal name of their entity. You are responsible for keeping your password private and secure, and are prohibited from sharing your login and password with others. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your user name.</p>
<h2>Changes to Auth3 Products and Terms</h2>
<p>Auth3 reserves the right at any time to modify, suspend, or discontinue providing the Product or any part thereof in its sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>
<p>Auth3 reserves the right at any time to modify these Terms in its sole discretion, without liability to you. This Agreement, as amended, will be effective upon use of the Auth3 Products for all existing users immediately after posting of any amended terms on the Auth3 website. You agree to be bound by this Agreement, as modified. If you do not agree to any changes to the Terms, you must stop using Auth3 and terminate your account immediately.</p>
<p>Please review the most current version of this Agreement from time to time, located at <a href="https://auth.tkluge.net/about/terms">https://auth.tkluge.net/about/terms</a> (or such successor URL as Auth3 may provide), so that you will be apprised of any changes.</p>
<h2>Term and Termination</h2>
<p>This Agreement is effective upon any use of Auth3 and remains in effect until your account is terminated. Terms that by their nature extend beyond termination shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Your right to use Auth3 automatically terminates if you fail to comply with these Terms. Auth3 reserves the right to refuse or discontinue participation to any user at any time at its sole discretion. You agree that, upon such termination, you will discontinue all use of the Products and that your access rights will immediately terminate.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>THE PRODUCTS AND ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Auth3 AND SUCH THIRD PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SECURITY, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICE AND SUCH THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE PRODUCT, AND ALL THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR THROUGH THE PRODUCT, AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE PRODUCT AND SUCH THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AND SERVICES.</p>
<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND WHERE THAT IS IN EFFECT, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL Auth3, OR ITS SUPPLIERS, RESELLERS, PARTNERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE PRODUCT, WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, (EVEN IF Auth3 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES).</p>
<p>WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF Auth3, AND ITS SUPPLIERS, RESELLERS, PARTNERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED (i) US$25 IF NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN PAID BY YOU TO Auth3 OR (ii) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR Auth3 IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE CLAIM.</p>
<p>THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE PRODUCT, FROM INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, OR FROM THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION OF THE PRODUCT (INCLUDING SUCH DAMAGES INCURRED BY THIRD PARTIES). SUCH LIMITATION SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING A FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR BODILY INJURY OR THE LIMITATIONS ABOVE AND IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<h2>Entire Agreement and Assignment</h2>
<p>This Agreement, which incorporates the Auth3 Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the Products. Auth3 failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by Auth3</p>
<p>You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement. Auth3 may freely assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be void.</p>
<p>If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted which as closely as possible reflects Auth3 intent.</p>
