					<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
<p>"Personal Information" is information that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a person. Your Personal Information is considered confidential and private to you.</p>
<p>You may be asked to provide your Personal Information when you create a Auth3 account or anytime you are in contact with us.</p>
<h2>Examples of Collected Personal Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>By creating / updating an account with Auth3, you may provide us with Personal Information including but not limited to your name, picture, email addresses, usernames, passwords, phone numbers, postal addresses and location information. We may also collect certain preference and demographic information from you.</li>
<li>By visiting other websites that may have placed Personal Information in your URL prior to coming to our website, which we have no control over, you may provide us with Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How We Do (and Do Not) Use Personal Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We will not sell your Personal Information to others.</p></li>
<li><p>We may use Personal Information to contact you via email to provide information related to our other products and services, and to personalize and better understand your use of the service.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may use Personal Information to help us develop, deliver and improve our products and services. This includes use for internal purposes such as auditing or research and analysis of our products, services and communications.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may occasionally use Personal Information to send you important notices such as software updates or notices related to your purchases and billing status, changes to our policies, or changes to our products or services. Because this information is critical in nature, you may not be able to opt out of receiving these notices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may use Personal Information to administer any special program you may have voluntarily entered into, such as a sweepstake, contest or promotion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may also combine your Personal Information with other information to provide and improve Auth3, our content, and advertising.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere in Auth3 according to your preferences. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If Personal Information is combined with Non-Personal information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information and will be treated under this Privacy Policy as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
<h2>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
<p>"Non-Personal Information" is information that does not permit identification of any specific person. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose Non-Personal Information.</p>
<h2>Here Are Some Examples of Non-Personal Information We Collect and How We May Use It:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We collect Non-Personal Information, including but not limited to language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser and Device type, mobile network provider/carrier, websites visited before and after ours, search terms used, location, and the time zone where Auth3 is used. Unless otherwise specified by local law, we consider Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers to be Non-Personal Information. We record this information in log files and use this type of information to better manage Auth3 usage and improve our products, services, and advertising.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We collect information related to activity usage, performance metrics and configuration settings on our website and from our products and services. This information is aggregated and used primarily to help us improve our website, products and services. Aggregated data is considered Non-Personal information and is not used to identify a person.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We also may use internal and third party analytic systems to analyze trends with Non-Personal Information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology Used to Collect Information</h2>
<p>To collect information, we use various technologies, such as “cookies”, pixel tags and web beacons on our website, in Auth3, and in email messages and advertisements. These technologies help improve the user experience – for example by keeping a user logged in and remembering their username or other information between sessions.</p>
<p>The method by which information is collected is not used to determine whether it is Personal Information or Non-Personal Information. Instead, that determination is made in accordance with definitions in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Legal requirements and policy enforcement</h3>
<p>It may be necessary – due to law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for us to disclose your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p>We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with our service terms, or to protect our operations or other users.</p>
<p>In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale or change of ownership we may transfer any and all information, including Personal Information we collect, to the new owner.</p>
<h3>Links to external websites</h3>
<p>Our websites may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies when visiting third party websites. We are not responsible for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our users.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Auth3 password private and secure. We strongly recommend against sharing your login and password with others.</p>
<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages that collect any Personal Information. Using an SSL-enabled browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer is required when your Personal Information is transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems but cannot guarantee these security measures will prevent third parties from obtaining Personal Information, Non Personal Information and Private Data Files by illegal actions or attacks. Should such an attack occur, we will notify you in accordance with local law and we will supply the appropriate authorities with available information on the third party in the event the attack comes under prosecution.</p>
<h2>Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>You may, at any time, update, correct or complete your Personal Information by accessing your Auth3 account. Your Personal Information and other information will be retained for as long as necessary to comply with this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. The latest revision of this policy will be published on a webpage accessible from <a href="https://auth.tkluge.net/about/privacy">https://auth.tkluge.net/about/privacy</a>. Your continued use of Auth3 will signify your acceptance and consent to all current policies and agreements.</p>
